# 🏝🐻 Welcome to My Profile! 🐻🏝

Hi there! 👋 I’m passionate about **game development** and love tinkering with **Python** to create quirky, "useless" apps 🙃 (though they're probably cooler than useless!).

As of **November 2024**, I’m trying out more programming languages to improve my skills and get familiar with new tools and technologies. 🚀

I’m working on adding more of my projects here, so stay tuned!

I have worked with [Evie](https://github.com/EvieDoesStuff) on various private *(so far)* projects—she’s been an amazing developer and friend for a while now 😄.
